          <h4>Discovering Javascript</h4>
          <p>
            I studied a professional cycle of Telecommunications and IT Systems in Spain. It was from 2010 to 2013.
            In 2018 I started studying again, online on the Open Webinars platform, I was focused on networks, and that is when I discovered programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            After studying basic programming and looking for a language I like, I took a Javascript course in 2019 on the Udemy platform at the beginning and I have been studying a lot since then in different places.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>What I like about Javascript</h4>
          <p>
            I enjoy solving challenges, I like to find a way to obtain a satisfactory result.
            Javascript is very versatile, I can use it both in backend and frontend, O.O.P and functional programming (learning FP is one of my goals in the future). Javascript is everywhere and as a developer you must know it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like working with Angular as a framework, I still have a lot to learn about it. I also like to work with pure Javascript.
            I am still learning about the different methods and every day I learn something new.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h4>In my life I enjoy</h4>
          <p>
            I love music most of all, I am a bass player. I like nature, walking, discovering culture, places and people. 
            I recently discovered meditation, it was very important to me, it changed my life. I try to practice it daily.
          </p>
          <p>I am Argentinian, I have been living in Spain and currently I live in Dublin.</p>

            <p>
              In this project I started to learn about Stripe and applied it in
              a simple way. It does not work as I would like, I am trying to fix
              some things. I am going to learn about Redux as my next goal and
              apply it here as well. Another next step in this project will be
              to make it responsive for small screens. It does right now, but
              not how I like it. I used Node and Express on the backend, using
              bcryptjs, json web token, cors and several more modules,
              Cloudinary as the file server, MongoDb as the database, and
              Angular on the frontend and Bootstrap.

            <p>
              I used Node and Express on the backend, using bcryptjs, json web
              token, cors and several more modules, Cloudinary as the file
              server, MongoDb as the database, and Angular on the frontend and
              Bootstrap I made this app because my wife is a cooking lover, has
              many recipes, and was on a low calorie diet, and she needed a
              quick way to save and find all her recipes, because she does not
              have much time to cook due to her work. I will continue working to
              improve it, I like the result I have at this time.
