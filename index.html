          <h4>Discovering Javascript</h4>
          <p>
            I studied a professional cycle of Telecommunications and IT Systems
            in Spain. It was from 2010 to 2013. In 2018 I started studying
            again, online on the Open Webinars platform, I was focused on
            networks, and that is when I discovered programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            After studying basic programming and looking for a language I like,
            I took a Javascript course in 2019 on the Udemy platform at the
            beginning and I have been studying a lot since then in different
            places.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>What I like about Javascript</h4>
          <p>
            I enjoy solving challenges, I like to find a way to obtain a
            satisfactory result. Javascript is very versatile, I can use it both
            in backend and frontend, O.O.P and functional programming (learning
            FP is one of my goals in the future).
          </p>
          <p>
            I can not really compare it to other languages ​​because I have not
            used another one (I started learning Python, but changed it to
            Javascript). What I like are its methods for manipulating data,
            objects and literals. I am learning a lot from this and I enjoy it
            very much.
          </p>
          <p>
            I use it to develop my backend in Node, and on the frontend I am
            using TypeScript because of Angular, but I like to use pure
            Javascript too, be it on the frontend, solving algorithms or
            wherever I need it.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>In my life I enjoy</h4>
          <p>
            I love music most of all, I am a bass player. I also like
            basketball, I have been playing here just before Covid and I am
            waiting to play again. I like nature, walking, discovering culture,
            places and people. I recently discovered meditation, it was very
            important to me, it changed my life. I try to practice it daily.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am Argentinian, I have been living in Spain and currently I live
            in Dublin.

              In this project I started to learn about Stripe and applied it in
              a simple way. It does not work as I would like, I am trying to fix
              some things. I am going to learn about Redux as my next goal and
              apply it here as well. Another next step in this project will be
              to make it responsive for small screens. It does right now, but
              not how I like it. I used Node and Express on the backend, using
              bcryptjs, json web token, cors and several more modules,
              Cloudinary as the file server, MongoDb as the database, and
              Angular on the frontend and Bootstrap.

            <p>
              I used Node and Express on the backend, using bcryptjs, json web
              token, cors and several more modules, Cloudinary as the file
              server, MongoDb as the database, and Angular on the frontend and
              Bootstrap I made this app because my wife is a cooking lover, has
              many recipes, and was on a low calorie diet, and she needed a
              quick way to save and find all her recipes, because she does not
              have much time to cook due to her work. I will continue working to
              improve it, I like the result I have at this time.

              Creating this dynamic page, I used Node, Express and some modules
              like: Express Handlebars, Morgan, Multer, moment and others. I
              used Mongoose to connect to MongoDB. For the styles I have used
              Bootstrap 4 and font-awesome. I was learning how to upload images
              at the time I created this page, I learn how to do it with Multer
              and I send them to Cloudinary.
