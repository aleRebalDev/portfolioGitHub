          <p>
            I studied a professional cycle of Telecommunications and IT Systems in Spain. It was from 2010 to 2013, but my situation and the country work moment did not allow me to work in this field as I wanted.
            In 2018 I started studying again, online on the Open Webinars platform, I was focused on networks, and that is when I discovered programming.

            After studying basic programming and looking for a language I like, I took a Javascript course in 2019 on the Udemy platform and recently finished it

            I like working with Angular, I am starting to work with Typecript with Node from the backend. I know that I have to improve and continue studying, and I will. I like to study and I know that in this field it is something basic.

            <p>
              In this project I started to learn about Stripe and applied it in
              a simple way. It does not work as I would like, I am trying to fix
              some things. I am going to learn about Redux as my next goal and
              apply it here as well. Another next step in this project will be
              to make it responsive for small screens. It does right now, but
              not how I like it. I used Node and Express on the backend, using
              bcryptjs, json web token, cors and several more modules,
              Cloudinary as the file server, MongoDb as the database, and
              Angular on the frontend and Bootstrap.

            <p>
              I used Node and Express on the backend, using bcryptjs, json web
              token, cors and several more modules, Cloudinary as the file
              server, MongoDb as the database, and Angular on the frontend and
              Bootstrap I made this app because my wife is a cooking lover, has
              many recipes, and was on a low calorie diet, and she needed a
              quick way to save and find all her recipes, because she does not
              have much time to cook due to her work. I will continue working to
              improve it, I like the result I have at this time.

              This page was created using Node, Express and several other
              modules: Express Handlebars such as templates, bcryptjs to encrypt
              user passwords, flash-connect to administrator messages, override
              method to be able to use put and remove method of frontend and
              passport form to users' navigations. I have used MongoDB as the
              database, connecting it through Mongoose. For styles I have used
              Bootstrap 4 and font-awesome
